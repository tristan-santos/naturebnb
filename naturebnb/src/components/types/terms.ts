4. How We Use Information

    Information collected is used only for academic and simulation purposes, including:

    Displaying property listings

    Testing Firestore database operations

    Practicing app development workflows

    Simulating host and guest interactions

    No data is shared, sold, or used for marketing or business purposes.

5. Data Storage and Security

    All data is stored securely in Firebase Firestore.

    Access is restricted to project developers or instructors.

    Information is used responsibly and kept private throughout the project duration.

    Since this is a school project, data is considered educational test data and may be deleted after the project ends.

6. Host Listing Rules
    a. Accuracy of Information

    Hosts must provide true and clear details in their listings, including descriptions, prices, and photos.
    Misleading or fake information may result in removal.

    b. Listing Removal Policy

    Hosts who wish to remove a listing must provide a 7-day notice before deletion.
    This allows verification and safe data updates in Firestore.
    Immediate removal may occur if the listing violates project or school rules.

7. Payment Simulation and Cancellations

    NatureBnB uses PayPal Sandbox, a testing tool for fake transactions.

    No real payments or refunds are made.

    Cancellations are simulated and may be handled by the project administrator for demonstration.
